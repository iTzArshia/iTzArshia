<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Arshia üëãüèª</h1>

I'm Arshia, an 19 year old developer from Iran that goes by "iTz Arshia" on media.

I joined Discord 4 years ago and soon got interested in creating servers, coding bots, managing communities, designing stuff and even made my community, iTz club, where I spend most of my time. After iTz Club I created a Discord bot called VOID, a verified, multipurpose bot that's been added to more than 1750 servers with unique commands that'd help you to moderate and manage your server/community in a better way.

I have had many projects (over 20 servers and 30 bots!); I've also worked with a lot of big servers and content creators, helping them to broaden and manage their communities on Discord.

Need help building your community or custom bot? You can [contact](https://discord.com/channels/@me/555688871023869952) me on Discord!
